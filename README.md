- Cd into the server directory (travel-tracker-api)
- In the command line, run npm install
- In the command line, run npm start

## Installation Instructions

- In your command line, cd into your local directory and clone down this repository -
- git clone https://github.com/jheidepriem/travel-tracker
- Cd into the repo
- Install the necessary package dependencies -
- npm install
- Run the command npm start
- With both the server running and this package running, then visit http://localhost:8080/ in your browser. **Upon       arriving to application
- In order to login to the application pick a user id between 1 and 50. (there are 50 users in the API)
- The username is traveler(theUserId) and the password is travel

### JavaScript

- You have to be very intentional with where you add your feature code. This repo uses a tool called [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to combine many JavaScript files into one big file. Webpack enables you to have many, separate JavaScript files to keep your code organized and readable. Webpack expects all of your code files to be in a specific place, or else it doesn't know how to combine them all behind the scenes.

## Running Your Tests

- Run your test suite using the command:

```bash
npm test
```
## Wins
- Very happy with how the final product turned out.
- Basically learning GET/POST for the first time was really fun!
- Learning how to test for sad paths! 

## Challenges

- Problem solving through how I wanted to set up my classes and how I wanted everything to interact in the scripts file. 
- The planning took a lot longer than I expected.
